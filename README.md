In this Notebook, I explored GoBike dataset, this dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco area.
I started by doing a bit of wrangling to the data as it required, then I moved into exploring and making visualization.

Summary of findings:

-	The majority of users were a subscriber, the Customers represent the minority
-	The males were the dominant
-	The majority of users were born between 1985 and 1995
-	The top stations in terms of starting the trip or ending it, had some commons
-	96.5% used the bike for 30min or less
-	Starting and ending trip's hours of the day were somewhat identical (maybe due to the previous finding)
